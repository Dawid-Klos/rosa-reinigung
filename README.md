## :thought_balloon: Rosa Reinigung - Cleaning services company based in Germany

Rosa Reinigung is a commercial website project developed with Gatsby.js

## Project Description

I have successfully designed, developed and launched a website for a cleaning company based in Germany. As a result of the project, the customers can check the information or book a service online. The client gained more time for the actual management of the company.


## Technologies used

- HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- Gatsby
- React
- SCSS
- Figma (Design prototypes)


## Project challenges

The main issue that had to be resolved was the excessive contact from customers who were asking the same questions (mainly about the services provided). To reduce the number of calls we introduced a website with an intuitive form allowing customers to book a desired service.

The created website informs users about the company. The major part of the website is a description of the offered services. Overall, the website helps customers to decide and book a service.

The booking process was split into several steps to ensure ease of use. Once a customer fills in the form and sends it, all the information arrives at the owner's email address. It helps keep the bookings and questions in one, manageable place.

Figma was used to prepare low-fidelity and high-fidelity prototypes adhering to the UI/UX principles. The main focus was to present the company's services in a beautiful way showing the love to clean and organized home which is the driving force behind the company. After working closely with the client a beautiful, clean and eye-catching design was developed.
